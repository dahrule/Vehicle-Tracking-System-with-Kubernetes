# Vehicle-Tracking-System-with-Kubernetes

KEY WORDS: IoT, RaspberryPi, Python, Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, Edge computing

Part of Internet of Things (IoT) Certificate: This prototype demonstrates a vehicle tracking system that utilizes IoT concepts. Users access a web-based UI to view vehicle routes, real-time locations, and add stops on a map.

I developed microservices with Python and Flask. Deployment and container management were handled using Docker and Kubernetes on Azure Kubernetes Service for the cloud and Minikube for edge devices. Data storage was managed with MongoDB and Redis.

Currently, the prototype generates simulated GPS coordinates via a Python script. The goal is to integrate GPS modules, Raspberry Pi as edge devices, and GSM connectivity.
